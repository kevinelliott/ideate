## Codebase Patterns
- Tauri v2 with React 19 + TypeScript frontend
- Tailwind CSS v4 with custom Apple-inspired design tokens in index.css
- Semantic colors via CSS variables: --background, --foreground, --secondary, --accent, --border, --card
- Tauri plugins already installed: dialog, fs, shell
- Use `pnpm run build` (runs tsc && vite build) for frontend typecheck/build
- Use `cargo build` in src-tauri for Rust backend builds
- SF Pro font family set in body CSS

## Initial Setup - PRD Creation
Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/T-019bab7f-d939-7764-bbdc-58a7742152ce
- Created prd.json with 28 properly-sized user stories
- Stories ordered by dependency: layout → stores → UI components → Tauri commands → build loop
- Each story is scoped to be completable in one iteration
