## Codebase Patterns
- Tauri v2 with React 19 + TypeScript frontend
- Tailwind CSS v4 with custom Apple-inspired design tokens in index.css
- Semantic colors via CSS variables: --background, --foreground, --secondary, --accent, --border, --card
- Tauri plugins installed: dialog, fs, shell
- Use `pnpm run build` (runs tsc && vite build) for frontend typecheck/build
- Use `cargo build` in src-tauri for Rust backend builds
- Components go in src/components/ directory
- Hooks go in src/hooks/ directory
- Stores go in src/stores/ directory (Zustand v5)
- Types go in src/types/ directory with index.ts barrel export
- Use .drag-region class for titlebar drag areas, .no-drag for buttons inside
- SF Pro font family set in body CSS
- Base component classes: .btn (primary, secondary, destructive, ghost, sm, lg), .input, .textarea, .select, .card, .card-interactive

- Verified sidebar layout component already implemented
- All acceptance criteria verified in browser:
  - Three-column layout: sidebar (240px) + main content + optional inspector ✓
  - Sidebar has vibrancy/translucent background effect (backdrop-blur-xl) ✓
  - Native macOS window controls space integrated ✓
  - Sidebar shows 'Projects' header and placeholder project list ✓
  - pnpm run build passes ✓
  - Browser verification complete ✓
- Files involved: src/components/Sidebar.tsx, src/App.tsx, src/components/MainContent.tsx
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Sidebar width is w-60 (240px) with vibrancy via bg-card/80 backdrop-blur-xl
  - Inspector panel is added later in US-012 (story detail panel)

- Verified Zustand store already implemented with all required functionality
- Zustand v5.0.9 installed in package.json
- ProjectStore in src/stores/projectStore.ts with:
  - projects: Project[] array
  - activeProjectId: string | null (equivalent to selectedProjectId)
  - Actions: addProject, removeProject, setActiveProject (selectProject), updateProject
- Project type defined with: id, name, description, path, status, createdAt
- ProjectStatus type: 'idle' | 'generating' | 'ready' | 'error'
- pnpm run build passes ✓
- Files involved: src/stores/projectStore.ts
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Project status is stored as activeProjectId not selectedProjectId (naming convention)
  - Store includes load/save actions for persistence (US-008)
  - Uses crypto.randomUUID() for id generation

- Verified Rust backend for project folder operations already implemented
- create_project(name, description, directory) creates folder with .ideate/ subdirectory ✓
- load_projects() returns project metadata from Application Support ✓
- Project metadata stored in .ideate/config.json via ProjectConfig struct ✓
- Error handling implemented with .map_err() pattern throughout ✓
- cargo check passes ✓
- Files involved: src-tauri/src/lib.rs
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - create_project takes (name, description, directory) not just (name, path)
  - load_projects() loads from Application Support, not from base_path scan
  - All Rust command errors use .map_err() for proper error handling

- Verified new project modal UI already implemented with all required functionality
- All acceptance criteria verified:
  - New Project button in sidebar opens modal ✓
  - Modal has: project name input, directory picker button, create/cancel buttons ✓
  - Directory picker uses Tauri's native file dialog (@tauri-apps/plugin-dialog) ✓
  - Create button calls Rust backend create_project command ✓
  - Modal closes and project appears in sidebar on success ✓
  - pnpm run build passes ✓
- Files involved: src/components/NewProjectModal.tsx, src/App.tsx, src/hooks/useModalKeyboard.ts, src-tauri/src/lib.rs
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - NewProjectModal uses @tauri-apps/plugin-dialog open() for native directory picker
  - Modal also has idea description textarea field beyond basic requirements
  - useModalKeyboard hook handles Escape key to close modals

- Verified project sidebar list already fully implemented
- All acceptance criteria verified:
  - Projects listed in sidebar with name and status icon ✓
  - Click project to select it (highlight selected) ✓
  - Selected project ID stored in Zustand (activeProjectId) ✓
  - Empty state shown when no projects exist ("No projects yet") ✓
  - pnpm run build passes ✓
  - Browser verification complete ✓
- Files involved: src/components/Sidebar.tsx, src/stores/projectStore.ts
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Project selection uses setActiveProject(project.id) from Zustand store
  - Status colors defined in statusColors object: idle=gray, generating=blue, ready=green, error=red
  - Context menu, rename, and delete modals are already integrated into Sidebar

- Verified projects persistence already fully implemented
- All acceptance criteria verified:
  - Projects saved to ~/Library/Application Support/Ideate/projects.json via get_projects_file_path() ✓
  - Projects loaded on app startup via loadProjects() in App.tsx useEffect ✓
  - Rust command save_projects (equivalent to save_projects_index) implemented ✓
  - Rust command load_projects (equivalent to load_projects_index) returns projects ✓
  - cargo check passes in src-tauri ✓
- Files involved: src-tauri/src/lib.rs, src/stores/projectStore.ts, src/App.tsx
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Commands named save_projects/load_projects (not save_projects_index/load_projects_index)
  - Auto-save triggered after addProject, removeProject, updateProject actions
  - Uses Tauri's app.path().app_data_dir() for cross-platform app data location

- Created PRD types and schema in src/types/prd.ts
- Types implemented:
  - PRD type with: project, description, branchName, userStories ✓
  - UserStory type: id, title, description, acceptanceCriteria, priority, passes, status, notes ✓
  - StoryStatus type: 'pending' | 'in-progress' | 'complete' | 'failed' | 'canceled' ✓
- Types exported from shared types file (src/types/index.ts) ✓
- pnpm run build passes ✓
- Files changed: src/types/prd.ts (new), src/types/index.ts (updated)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - UserStory includes both 'passes' boolean (for PRD tracking) and 'status' (for UI display)
  - Types follow existing pattern in types directory with barrel export via index.ts
