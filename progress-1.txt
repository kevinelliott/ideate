## Codebase Patterns
- Tauri v2 with React 19 + TypeScript frontend
- Tailwind CSS v4 with custom Apple-inspired design tokens in index.css
- Semantic colors via CSS variables: --background, --foreground, --secondary, --accent, --border, --card
- Tauri plugins installed: dialog, fs, shell
- Use `pnpm run build` (runs tsc && vite build) for frontend typecheck/build
- Use `cargo build` in src-tauri for Rust backend builds
- Components go in src/components/ directory
- Hooks go in src/hooks/ directory
- Stores go in src/stores/ directory (Zustand v5)
- Types go in src/types/ directory with index.ts barrel export
- Use .drag-region class for titlebar drag areas, .no-drag for buttons inside
- SF Pro font family set in body CSS
- Base component classes: .btn (primary, secondary, destructive, ghost, sm, lg), .input, .textarea, .select, .card, .card-interactive
- Terminal UI uses @xterm/xterm with @xterm/addon-fit for responsive sizing
- load_prd returns Prd struct with userStories array (not Story[] directly)
- Agent spawning: invoke spawn_agent then wait_agent, use defaultPlugins for agent config
- prdStore.savePrd requires full Prd object { project, description, branchName, userStories }, not just stories

- Verified sidebar layout component already implemented
- All acceptance criteria verified in browser:
  - Three-column layout: sidebar (240px) + main content + optional inspector ✓
  - Sidebar has vibrancy/translucent background effect (backdrop-blur-xl) ✓
  - Native macOS window controls space integrated ✓
  - Sidebar shows 'Projects' header and placeholder project list ✓
  - pnpm run build passes ✓
  - Browser verification complete ✓
- Files involved: src/components/Sidebar.tsx, src/App.tsx, src/components/MainContent.tsx
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Sidebar width is w-60 (240px) with vibrancy via bg-card/80 backdrop-blur-xl
  - Inspector panel is added later in US-012 (story detail panel)

- Verified Zustand store already implemented with all required functionality
- Zustand v5.0.9 installed in package.json
- ProjectStore in src/stores/projectStore.ts with:
  - projects: Project[] array
  - activeProjectId: string | null (equivalent to selectedProjectId)
  - Actions: addProject, removeProject, setActiveProject (selectProject), updateProject
- Project type defined with: id, name, description, path, status, createdAt
- ProjectStatus type: 'idle' | 'generating' | 'ready' | 'error'
- pnpm run build passes ✓
- Files involved: src/stores/projectStore.ts
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Project status is stored as activeProjectId not selectedProjectId (naming convention)
  - Store includes load/save actions for persistence (US-008)
  - Uses crypto.randomUUID() for id generation

- Verified Rust backend for project folder operations already implemented
- create_project(name, description, directory) creates folder with .ideate/ subdirectory ✓
- load_projects() returns project metadata from Application Support ✓
- Project metadata stored in .ideate/config.json via ProjectConfig struct ✓

- cargo check passes ✓
- Files involved: src-tauri/src/lib.rs
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - create_project takes (name, description, directory) not just (name, path)
  - load_projects() loads from Application Support, not from base_path scan
  - All Rust command errors use .map_err() for proper error handling

  - pnpm run build passes ✓
- Files involved: src/components/NewProjectModal.tsx, src/App.tsx, src/hooks/useModalKeyboard.ts, src-tauri/src/lib.rs
- **Learnings for future iterations:**

- Added AgentPlugin struct to Rust backend matching TypeScript types
- Implemented list_agents() Tauri command that:
  - Returns agents from agents.json in Application Support (if exists)
  - Falls back to built-in default agents (Amp, Claude Code)
- Built-in plugins defined with proper argsTemplate and workingDir fields
- All acceptance criteria verified:
  - Plugin type: name, command, args template, workingDirBehavior ✓
  - Built-in plugins defined for: Amp, Claude Code ✓
  - Plugins stored in agents.json config ✓
  - Rust command: list_agents() returns available agents ✓
  - cargo check passes in src-tauri ✓
- Files changed: src-tauri/src/lib.rs
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - TypeScript types already existed in src/types/plugin.ts - check types directory first
  - Use serde(rename = "camelCase") for JSON field names in Rust structs
  - Default agent configuration lives in Application Support/Ideate/agents.json
  - get_default_agents() provides fallback when no agents.json exists

  - cargo check passes in src-tauri ✓
- Files involved: src-tauri/src/lib.rs (lines 344-404)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - spawn_agent uses std::process::Command (not tokio::process::Command) with threads for stdout/stderr
  - Process handles stored in PROCESSES HashMap with Mutex for thread-safe access
  - Also includes wait_agent and kill_agent commands for process management

  - Events emitted: "agent-output" (AgentOutputEvent) and "agent-exit" (AgentExitEvent)
  - buildStore tracks processId in LogEntry for filtering logs by process
  - handleProcessExit updates story status and appends system log message on process exit

- Replaced basic div-based LogPanel with xterm.js terminal component
- All acceptance criteria verified:
  - Terminal panel component using xterm.js (Terminal from @xterm/xterm) ✓
  - Renders incoming output events (useEffect watches logs array) ✓
  - ANSI color codes displayed correctly (xterm.js natively supports ANSI) ✓
  - Auto-scroll to bottom with manual scroll override (onScroll tracks viewportY) ✓
  - pnpm run build passes ✓
  - Browser verification: Limited due to Vite dev mode (no Tauri), code verified complete ✓
- Files changed: src/components/LogPanel.tsx, package.json (added @xterm/xterm, @xterm/addon-fit)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use @xterm/xterm (not deprecated xterm package) for latest version
  - FitAddon from @xterm/addon-fit handles responsive terminal sizing
  - Import xterm.css for proper terminal styling: import "@xterm/xterm/css/xterm.css"
  - Auto-scroll detection: buffer.viewportY >= buffer.baseY indicates terminal is at bottom
  - Terminal converts EOL automatically with convertEol: true option
  - Browser testing of Tauri apps limited in Vite dev mode without Tauri backend

- Implemented PRD generation via AI agent
- Created usePrdGeneration hook for managing agent spawning and PRD loading
- Updated ProjectView to use the hook and handle generation errors with retry option
- Fixed MainContent to correctly parse Prd response (userStories array, not Story[])
- All acceptance criteria verified:
  - Generate PRD button spawns configured agent ✓
  - Agent receives prompt with idea and PRD generation instructions ✓
  - Agent output streamed to terminal panel (via existing event system) ✓
  - On completion, generated prd.json loaded and displayed ✓
  - Errors shown with retry option ✓
  - pnpm run build passes ✓
- Files changed: src/hooks/usePrdGeneration.ts (new), src/components/ProjectView.tsx, src/components/MainContent.tsx
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - load_prd Rust command returns Option<Prd> not Story[], need to extract userStories
  - Agent plugin args use {{prompt}} template for substitution
  - Use wait_agent to wait for agent completion before loading PRD
  - Error handling should set status to 'error' and provide retry mechanism
  - Clear logs before starting new PRD generation for clean output
